# Mask Projection Generator

## Overview

This Python project is designed to generate mask projections from image data. The primary functionality includes the application of masks to images and the simulation of the propagation of these masked images based on various parameters. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, Pillow (PIL), Torch
- Dataset: Mnist(binary version is used in this project, please see test_label_binary and train_label_binary)

## Run it
- Open cmd, navigate to the script's directory, and then:
- <pre> python generator_mask_projection.py<pre>
- or you can create a Jupyter notebook under the same directory as generator_mask_projection.py and other .py files  then:
- <pre> run generator_mask_projection.py<pre>
